# basic_calculator

A simple calculator with options for basic arithmetic operations on two numbers and an exit option.

## How to use it?

You need a **C compiler** (like GCC, which is included in Code::Blocks) to compile the source code.

## Steps

1.  **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Compile** the C source code (`basic_calculator.c`) using a C compiler. For example, using GCC in a terminal:

    ```
    On Windows, you might get `basic_calculator.exe`.
3.  **Run** the compiled executable:
    ```bash
    ./basic_calculator
    ```
    or on Windows:
    ```bash
    basic_calculator.exe
    ```
