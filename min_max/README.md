# min_max

A simple program to calculate the minimum and the maximum value from a sequence of integer inputs. The input sequence is terminated by the word "done".

## How to use it?

You need a **C compiler** (like GCC, which is included in Code::Blocks) to compile the source code.

## Steps

1.  **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2.  **Compile** the C source code (`min_max.c`) using a C compiler. For example, using GCC in a terminal:
    ```bash
    gcc min_max.c -o min_max
    ```
    On Windows, you might get `min_max.exe`.
3.  **Run** the compiled executable:
    ```bash10
    ./min_max
    ```
    or on Windows:
    ```bash
    min_max.exe
    ```

## Example

```
Enter an integer or "done" to exit: 10
Enter an integer or "done" to exit: 5
Enter an integer or "done" to exit: 20
Enter an integer or "done" to exit: done
Maximum 20
Minimum 5
```
